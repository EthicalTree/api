2926,NORTHSIDE espresso + kitchen,5,"Northside is inspired by the thriving cafe culture of Melbourne, Australia, where coffee is not just a caffeine fix, but a way of life. Combining the essential Aussie trinity of delicious brekkie, friendly service and third wave coffee, Northside is a space to take a pause from the busyness of everyday life, soak up the atmosphere and leave feeling a like you’re a part of it all.

Born from the love of our morning ritual, we wanted to bring to Kingston our take on what coffee and brekkie really means to Melbournians: authentic service, genuine connection and high quality products, all in a space where you feel at home.

We are ridiculously passionate about coffee, food and the people we work with, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. It’s breakfast, it’s supposed to be fun and relaxed.
