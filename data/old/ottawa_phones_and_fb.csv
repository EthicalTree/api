1485,Inner Echo,91,"Jewelry & Scents To Raise Your Vibration

It is believed that positivity vibrates at high frequencies, and that negativity vibrates at low frequencies. Gemstones and essential oils are said to emit very high frequencies of energy, attracting back more of that same energy. In turn, this raises the vibration of the person who is wearing/using them. This concept is what inspired us to create Inner Echo!

All of our malas and intentional jewelry pieces are made up of powerful authentic gemstones that each have their own unique healing properties. We never use synthetic beads like glass or plastic and always source the highest quality gems available. We also ensure the use of nylon cord as opposed to silk, so our products are VEGAN!

Our essential oil blends are made with 100% pure, natural, steam-distilled essential oils, without any artificial/synthetic fragrances added.

Our goal with our pieces and products is to provide multi-functional items that not only LOOK and SMELL good, but make you FEEL good too!

We believe that life is like an echo. What you put out into the universe comes back to you. When you vibrate at a high frequency, your experiences and surroundings do the same.

Plants are abundant in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Studies have shown that plant-based diets can help you lose weight, lower risks of certain cancers and heart disease, lower cholesterol, improve kidney function and type 2 diabetes.

By choosing to eat plant-based, you are also significantly lowering your environmental footprint.

Just as important, plant-based cuisine is delicious!  

Here's how it works:

1. Our chefs create a new menu weekly, inspired by seasonal produce.
2. We then prep, package, and ship farm fresh ingredients with recipes to your door.
