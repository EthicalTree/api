4021,Hugh's Room Live,750,"Hugh's Room, Toronto's beloved acoustic music club, closed its doors suddenly and unexpectedly in January 2017 after 16 years of operation.  

There was an immediate and overwhelming response to this potential loss to the musical community, with substantial coverage  in the local and national media (Toronto Star, Globe & Mail, Toronto Sun, Now, Exclaim, National Post, Jazz-FM, CBC, CTV, Global, insidetoronto.com, WholeNote, and many others).  

Many members of the music community and public have asked how they could help to save or revive their beloved Hugh's Room.

In response, a working group of volunteers assembled and has developed a viable plan for re-opening Hugh's Room as a not-for-profit organization.  The group includes lawyers, business people, accountants, music promoters, publicists, venue operators and members of the community (members are listed below).  Grit Laskin has been named spokesperson for the working group.  

The group has determined that Hugh's Room can clearly sustain itself financially going forward.  With the right infrastructure and community support, the legacy of Hugh's Room can be continued.  Toronto can continue to have a destination venue that presents the genres, variety and high quality of music that Hugh's Room is renowned for across the continent.

What’s the plan?
A new community based not-for-profit organization has incorporated and will open the new club as Hugh's Room Live.



Fundraising goal is $250,000 with the first $30,000 required by February 20,  THIS BENCHMARK HAS BEEN MET. 

Another $45,000 by March 5.  

THIS GOAL HAS BEEN MET ! 

Another $50,00 by April 15

PLEASE DONATE NOW TO HELP US MEET THIS GOAL.


Please show your support and make your donation as early as possible to ensure Hugh's Room can re-open. 

Who is involved ? 
The working group came together informally, in response to the news of Hugh’s Room’s closing.  All are fans of Hugh’s Room, and wanted to explore how it could re‑open as a community‑owned venture. It includes:

Jeremy Darby, owner Canterbury Music Co (recording studio)

Howard Gladstone, businessman, musician, co-founder Toronto City Roots Festival 2004-2010

Jane Harbury, freelance publicist, has worked for Hugh's Room for many years

Brian Iler, lawyer, chair Northwinds Folk Festival (1984/85), engaged with many community initiatives

Grit Laskin, musician, luthier, member Order of Canada, spokesperson for the Hugh's Room working committee

Judith Laskin, retired educator, founding board member CFMA,  director The Woods Music & Dance Camp, past board member Mariposa Folk Festival under Estelle Klein

Brian Litvin, accountant and musician

Franks Saunders, businessman, involved with presentation and production of folk events

Rob Young, advertising executive and musician 


How was the fundraising goal set?

The fundraising goal was established after an analysis of the previous operation. Our conclusion was that the club is financially viable, but operated in a cash deficit position. The fundraising goal is considered adequate to ensure the financial stability of the new club.  Necessary allocations of the funds include: purchasing the assets, securing a lease from the property owner, providing working cash for the operation, and providing a  financial buffer. 

What about financial transparency? 

As a not-for-profit community-based operation, Hugh’s Room for the Performing Arts will release its budgets and financial statements. 


What about people who bought tickets to cancelled shows? 

The working group is acutely aware of the financial fallout from the cancelled shows, for both audience and artists alike.  Patrons contact your credit card company for a refund after the show date has passed.

What about the former employees of the old Hugh's Room? 

The new organization (Hugh's Room for the Performing Arts)  is committed to re-opening the club as soon as possible.  Doing that is the best way to assist employees who have been hurt by the closure. Our plan is to re-hire as many of them as we can, as soon as we can.   Most former employees have expressed interest in returning.  The original general manager Anthony Ferrando is returning.

The spectrum of Pero Restaurant cuisine can be said to lie between are two dietary extremes: vegetarianism and carnivorism. The essence of good Eastern African cooking revolves around the appropriate use of aromatic spices. The skill lies in subtle blending of a variety of spices to enhance, rather than overwhelm the basic flavour of a particular dish. Pero's food relies on the spices in which it is cooked, just as Japanese Sushi relies on the freshness of the meat, and Chinese food relies on the various sauces to impart the right flavour and taste. It is interesting to see an Eastern African chef at work, with a palette of spices, gratuitously sprinkling these powders in exact pinches into the dish in front of him. It is these complexities of regional food in Eastern Africa that make it a so very fascinating experience.

The skill lies in subtle blending of a variety of spices to enhance, rather than overwhelm the basic flavour of a particular dish. Pero's food relies on the spices in which it is cooked, just as Japanese Sushi relies on the freshness of the meat, and Chinese food relies on the various sauces to impart the right flavour and taste. It is interesting to see an Eastern African chef at work, with a palette of spices, gratuitously sprinkling these powders in exact pinches into the dish in front of him. It is these complexities of regional food in Eastern Africa that make it a so very fascinating experience. Pero aims to bring the most traditional dishes from all corners of Eastern Africa, maintain the classic Eritrean recipes and enhance the offering with some signature dishes to reflect the changing food trends in modern Africa.",0,Pero Restaurant and Lounge

3009,Gurulukshmi,750,"After searching for an Authentic South Indian Restaurant, my wife (Thana) and I (Kumar) realized that Canada was deprived of it. So we decided to open just that, an Authentic South Indian Restaurant with personal touch and care paid to our unbeatable taste and customer service. As I come from a family of Restaurant owners, and I being a business man since 1975 and blessed with an excellent cook, as my wife, we started our venture. Soon our two daughters, who were more than willing to help, joined our team. Our elders have been cooking and mastering the culinary art for many years in which many secret recipes have been created and passed on. With their blessings and knowledge we literally 'exposed' our kitchen and heart to our valued customers since 2003. From the very first day we have never compromised freshness, cleanliness or taste. We take on the challenge of living up to and soaring above the high standards that our customers have set for us. This was possible only after we started making the food ourselves rather than depending on outside commercial cooks...

So we decided to open just that, an Authentic South Indian Restaurant with personal touch and care paid to our unbeatable taste and customer service. As I come from a family of Restaurant owners, and I being a business man since 1975 and blessed with an excellent cook, as my wife, we started our venture. Soon our two daughters, who were more than willing to help, joined our team. Our elders have been cooking and mastering the culinary art for many years in which many secret recipes have been created and passed on. With their blessings and knowledge we literally 'exposed' our kitchen and heart to our valued customers since 2003. From the very first day we have never compromised freshness, cleanliness or taste. We take on the challenge of living up to and soaring above the high standards that our customers have set for us. This was possible only after we started making the food ourselves rather than depending on outside commercial cooks...

The team at Prairie Girl is proud of our incredible cupcakes! We LOVE to talk about how they are made fresh on-site every single day from fresh dairy butter, 70% Dark Belgian Chocolate, real strawberries and tons of other top of the line ingredients!

November 14, 2011 we opened up our second location in the Path.  Located in the concourse level of First Canadian Place, we deliver the same great product, but available at 8am for those early risers, and wonderfully convenient as the cold approaches.

April 26, 2013 We opened our third location in the trendy neighbourhood of Yorkville! Now our cupcakes are conveniently available uptown still served with a smile! 

Because of our commitment to ""fresh"" each of our stores has it's own kitchen where our favourite products are baked everyday. This means that sometimes we sell out early due to a higher demand than expected. This also means some days we have leftovers and because of our love and dedication to the community in which we work, we give our end-of-day cupcakes to a couple of Second Harvest agencies nearby our stores.

We have loved meeting new customers every day while getting to know our loyal regulars.

The team at Prairie Girl is proud of our incredible cupcakes! We LOVE to talk about how they are made fresh on-site every single day from fresh dairy butter, 70% Dark Belgian Chocolate, real strawberries and tons of other top of the line ingredients!

November 14, 2011 we opened up our second location in the Path.  Located in the concourse level of First Canadian Place, we deliver the same great product, but available at 8am for those early risers, and wonderfully convenient as the cold approaches.

April 26, 2013 We opened our third location in the trendy neighbourhood of Yorkville! Now our cupcakes are conveniently available uptown still served with a smile! 

Because of our commitment to ""fresh"" each of our stores has it's own kitchen where our favourite products are baked everyday. This means that sometimes we sell out early due to a higher demand than expected. This also means some days we have leftovers and because of our love and dedication to the community in which we work, we give our end-of-day cupcakes to a couple of Second Harvest agencies nearby our stores.

Stay connected with Prairie Girl and you'll get chances to take part in contests and giveaways all the time! :)

Do you sit at home wondering where you can be satisfied mouth-ly, stomach-ly and wallet-ly?

Why are you not eating a delicious ROTI right now?

Pam's Caribbean Kitchen offers a great variety of some of the best ingredients a Roti could possibly fit into itself!

Whether you are a vegetarian, meat head, or a spice seeker this place should be a regular stop for you. 

With a ""Not-So-Fast-Food"" approach to cooking, be ready to sit tight while Pam Singh prepares a taste that will forever make other curry dishes seem bland by comparison.

These rotis are so big, they can last you for 2 meals, or if you eat it in one, YOU WILL NOT EAT FOR DAYS, and will possibly die from palate pleasure.

4329,The Grover Pub & Grub,750,"Who we are.

Once upon a time, our family decided to buy a bar. As lovers of craft beer and a good challenge, we jumped at the opportunity to create a local space where the community could just kick back with a brew. The Grover has been a local institution since 1982, and with its recent rebirth, lives on as a favourite community hub. Expect perfectly poured ""brewtiful"" craft pints, damn good pub fare, awesome staff, and fabulous events :)

Once upon a time, our family decided to buy a bar. As lovers of craft beer and a good challenge, we jumped at the opportunity to create a local space where the community could just kick back with a brew. The Grover has been a local institution since 1982, and with its recent rebirth, lives on as a favourite community hub. Expect perfectly poured ""brewtiful"" craft pints, damn good pub fare, awesome staff, and fabulous events :)

3195,Fiesta Farms,750,"Fiesta Farms is Toronto’s largest inde­pen­dently owned gro­cery store and gar­den cen­tre. What does that mean? It means we only have one store. But it’s a big one. “Largest” means we carry the range of prod­ucts you’d expect from a chain. “Independent” means we can choose what those prod­ucts are-who makes them, where they come from, what’s in them, their place in the local econ­omy. Stuff like that.

And we’re pretty choosy.

Partly because being choosy is good, and partly because it’s good busi­ness. When we opened up over 20 years ago, we decided to focus on two things the big guys couldn’t com­pete with: serv­ing our local eth­nic com­mu­ni­ties and sup­port­ing our local econ­omy. Now those things are pop­u­lar. And so are we!

A visit to the store will let you know pretty quickly that we don’t turn our nose up at any­one, but we tend to be par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar with folks who get more from food shop­ping than just a full larder. As it turns out, food mat­ters to a lot of peo­ple for a lot of dif­fer­ent reasons.

We help them cel­e­brate those rea­sons by mak­ing organic, local, eth­i­cal, eth­nic, healthy, gourmet, arti­san and tra­di­tional fare acces­si­ble. We’ve got lots of it. We keep the prices for it all rea­son­able. And we sell it with­out the pomp. We wouldn’t know how to pull off pomp if the Queen were com­ing to pick up a Fenwood Farms chicken.

What we  can pull off are part­ner­ships with great orga­ni­za­tions like Local Food Plus, who under­stand the impor­tance of devel­op­ing and pro­mot­ing local entre­pre­neurs to our econ­omy and our envi­ron­ment.

What does that mean? It means we only have one store. But it’s a big one. “Largest” means we carry the range of prod­ucts you’d expect from a chain. “Independent” means we can choose what those prod­ucts are-who makes them, where they come from, what’s in them, their place in the local econ­omy. Stuff like that.

And we’re pretty choosy.

Partly because being choosy is good, and partly because it’s good busi­ness. When we opened up over 20 years ago, we decided to focus on two things the big guys couldn’t com­pete with: serv­ing our local eth­nic com­mu­ni­ties and sup­port­ing our local econ­omy. Now those things are pop­u­lar. And so are we!

A visit to the store will let you know pretty quickly that we don’t turn our nose up at any­one, but we tend to be par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar with folks who get more from food shop­ping than just a full larder. As it turns out, food mat­ters to a lot of peo­ple for a lot of dif­fer­ent reasons.

We help them cel­e­brate those rea­sons by mak­ing organic, local, eth­i­cal, eth­nic, healthy, gourmet, arti­san and tra­di­tional fare acces­si­ble. We’ve got lots of it. We keep the prices for it all rea­son­able. And we sell it with­out the pomp. We wouldn’t know how to pull off pomp if the Queen were com­ing to pick up a Fenwood Farms chicken.

What we  can pull off are part­ner­ships with great orga­ni­za­tions like Local Food Plus, who under­stand the impor­tance of devel­op­ing and pro­mot­ing local entre­pre­neurs to our econ­omy and our envi­ron­ment. And orga­ni­za­tions like The Stop and The New Farm, who help peo­ple exer­cise their right to good food, whether they can afford it or not.

The Fix and Co provides fresh pressed juices, salad bowls and other freshly made goods in the Six and surrounding areas.

The Fix + Co was created in 2015 by two girls who have a passion for educating the community on healthy eating. Their mission is to provide high quality, nutritious and convenient meals to customers by delivery.  The Fix emerged out of a belief that today’s consumers are becoming more enlightened about the detrimental effects of eating typical convenience junk foods that are highly processed, with little to no nutritional value. Today’s consumer is becoming more health conscious and wants to take back their right to choose healthy and nutritiously dense foods that will benefit their overall well-being. The consumer wants to know where their food is coming from and what their meals are made of. This is where The Fix comes in. The Fix believes that educating the community on healthy eating is the first step to achieving a healthy, fulfilled lifestyle.

2869,Eva's Original Chimneys,750,"WHO IS EVA?

Eva is the grandmother of co-owner Justin Butler. She was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary and travelled to Canada with her children during the Hungarian Revolution of the 1950s. Family trips to Budapest eating Kürtőskalács (Chimneys) are the inspiration for Eva's Original Chimneys.

WHAT'S A CHIMNEY?

Known as Kürtöskalács in Hungarian, Chimney cakes are delicious and unique freshly baked Hungarian pastries, named after their hollow, cylindrical shape.

EVA'S INGREDIENTS

Our Chimney Cakes and Cones are cooked using a traditional-style rotisserie grill and are baked, not fried.

The dough base is suitable for vegans and our staff can advise on what toppings are suitable for vegans, too.

The base ingredients of each Chimney are: unbleached flour, organic coconut milk, organic cane sugar, sunflower oil, lemon, fresh yeast and sea salt.

We work with a local baker, Val of Sweet Carnival Cakes, to make our delicious toppings from scratch using premium ingredients.  

OUR CASHLESS POLICY

It’s not that we don’t want your cash ;)  But, Eva’s is operating with electronic payments only so we can be faster, more hygienic and more accurate for everyone! Hygiene is particularly important to us as our entire kitchen is out front where the register is.

2950,Apiecalypse Now - Pizza & Snack Bar,750,"After winning best bakery in the city for 2014, we've decided to expand and Innovate! Opening in 2015, Toronto's first vegan Pizza Shop & Snack Bar!

What's a snack bar? That's the real beautiful part of this whole thing--it's basically your vegan junk food dreams come alive. Vegan Corn Dogs... Vegan Doughnuts... Vegan Cheezy Garlic Bread... Buffalo Ranch Salads and Vegan Not-Chicken Caesar Salads. 

Our pizzas are done in an authentic pizza oven that never even one time has had meat in it. Also aren't you tired of omnivores just sprinkling some Daiya on some crust and calling it vegan pizza? We 1) know how to make vegan cheese taste like the real thing 2) we make our own mock meat and we know how to cook it so it doesn't taste like a mummy's fingers 3) We understand how wholly sick you are or just eating tomato sauce and veggies. 

For too long Toronto has envied all those American cities with real vegan toppings and more than one vegan sauce base, and dip... remember GARLIC DIP? We do. And we got you. We have 6 kinds of dip. And you can eat all of it. 

Fool your friends! P00n your hockey team by making them eat vegetarian and totally not know! Maybe die at a slightly slower rate because you didn't eat bacon today! Just come get some authentically vegan, not passably vegan pizza and stuff it in your cool beautiful faces.

Our pizzas are done in an authentic pizza oven that never even one time has had meat in it. Also aren't you tired of omnivores just sprinkling some Daiya on some crust and calling it vegan pizza?

Our Story

We have taken the name Leela from the play /theatre Ram-Leela. Leela is a dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Lord Rama, ending up in ten-day battle between Rama and Ravana, as described in the Hindu religious epic, the Ramayana. A tradition that originates from the Indian-subcontinent, the play is staged annually, often over ten or more successive nights, during the auspicious period of Navratras which marks the commencement of the Autumn festive period, starting with the Dussehra festival. Usually the performances are timed to culminate on the festival day, that commemorates the victory of Rama over demon king Ravana, when the actors are taken out in a procession through the city, leading up to a mela (fairground) ground or town square, where the enactment of the final battle takes place, before giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran and son Meghanath are set on fire and coronation of Rama at Ayodhaya takes place, marking the culmination of festivities and restoration of the divine order.

The Food

With the opening of Leela, Hemant brings the flavours of his home country stateside, showcasing his Indian heritage through Canadian ingredients. The food at Leela covers all regions of India, and celebrates the wonders of Indian ‘Dhaba’ (road-side eatery in every neighbourhood or highways) food along with lesser-known dishes. The portions are all tapas style.

 Tasting Menu

The most important part of the menu is the Banana Leaf Tasting Menu - A tasting menu with most delicious colonial Indian dishes. All served in small bowls and usually on a fresh banana leaf. At the time India was a Brit Colony, people used to show off their wealth by serving in silver platters. Our fun menu does a spoof on those platters and we serve on fresh banana leaf.

Cross-Over Interpretation of Indian 

Some will argue that cross-over interpretation of Indian street food comes at a cost of authenticity but Hemant Bhagwani disagrees. He believes that we need to revolutionize Indian food to represent its accomplishments and diversity on foreign shores, to be able to innovate you have to go back to tradition. It’s about adapting your food to local cultures and palates and at the same time reviving old forgotten Indian street food dishes by giving them a fun makeover to attract the attention it deserves. “with one foot in future and one in past, the menu at Leela reads a romantic fairy tale of “desi khana” marrying innovative Indian Food.",,,Indian Restaurant,gd_place,publish,,1,0,Never,2018-05-05 22:08,"3108 Dundas Street West,",Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,43.6656214,-79.4734771,The Junction,43.6462487,-79.3904529,,4167697777,info@leelabyamaya.com,http://Leelaindianfoodbar.ca,,https://www.facebook.com/LeelaIndianFoodBar/,,,,,,Get Directions,,,,0,,0,http://ettest.pow7.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30623661_1659374087487632_1454939898304790528_n.jpg,http://ettest.pow7.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30716009_1668811719877202_5537942569608019968_n.jpg,http://ettest.pow7.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30595013_1659169250841449_6553909747672678400_n.jpg,http://ettest.pow7.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/16114421_1228231747268537_2056203005573738200_n.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LeelaIndianFoodBar,"{'mon_1_open': '12:00', 'mon_1_close': '22:00', 'tue_1_open': '12:00', 'tue_1_close': '22:00', 'wed_1_open': '12:00', 'wed_1_close': '22:00', 'thu_1_open': '12:00', 'thu_1_close': '22:00', 'fri_1_open': '12:00', 'fri_1_close': '22:00', 'sat_1_open': '12:00', 'sat_1_close': '22:00', 'sun_1_open': '12:00', 'sun_1_close': '22:00'}",Vegetarian;,,,"INDIAN HALF PLATES & FULL DRINKS

A tradition that originates from the Indian-subcontinent, the play is staged annually, often over ten or more successive nights, during the auspicious period of Navratras which marks the commencement of the Autumn festive period, starting with the Dussehra festival. Usually the performances are timed to culminate on the festival day, that commemorates the victory of Rama over demon king Ravana, when the actors are taken out in a procession through the city, leading up to a mela (fairground) ground or town square, where the enactment of the final battle takes place, before giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran and son Meghanath are set on fire and coronation of Rama at Ayodhaya takes place, marking the culmination of festivities and restoration of the divine order.

The Food

With the opening of Leela, Hemant brings the flavours of his home country stateside, showcasing his Indian heritage through Canadian ingredients. The food at Leela covers all regions of India, and celebrates the wonders of Indian ‘Dhaba’ (road-side eatery in every neighbourhood or highways) food along with lesser-known dishes. The portions are all tapas style.

 Tasting Menu

The most important part of the menu is the Banana Leaf Tasting Menu - A tasting menu with most delicious colonial Indian dishes. All served in small bowls and usually on a fresh banana leaf. At the time India was a Brit Colony, people used to show off their wealth by serving in silver platters. Our fun menu does a spoof on those platters and we serve on fresh banana leaf.

Cross-Over Interpretation of Indian 

Some will argue that cross-over interpretation of Indian street food comes at a cost of authenticity but Hemant Bhagwani disagrees. He believes that we need to revolutionize Indian food to represent its accomplishments and diversity on foreign shores, to be able to innovate you have to go back to tradition. It’s about adapting your food to local cultures and palates and at the same time reviving old forgotten Indian street food dishes by giving them a fun makeover to attract the attention it deserves. “with one foot in future and one in past, the menu at Leela reads a romantic fairy tale of “desi khana” marrying innovative Indian Food.",0,Leela Indian Food Bar

Under the tutelage of Toronto native, Kevin Prendergast, our culinary brigade offers a wealth of cooking techniques and styles, thanks to their multicultural and ethnically diverse backgrounds. 

Inspired by fresh, locally sourced produce and protein, sustainable seafood and foraged gems from independent purveyors, our team passionately makes each dining experience unique … depending on the season and the ingredients.

The wine list is well sourced offering variety in by the glass, on tap, bottle and vintage selections.  Canadian craft beer and cocktails that are both classic, yet original are always available. 

Tundra is elegant and stylish, yet relaxed and welcoming with warm, excellent service and always an enchanting experience.  It is conveniently located in the heart of the city at Richmond and University Avenue, within the contemporary  Hilton Toronto hotel.  

Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner with well tailored menus for all dining experiences from power breakfasts to pre-theatre prix fixe menus to corporate, casual or formal events.
